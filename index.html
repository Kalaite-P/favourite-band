    Fifth Harmony, often shortened to 5H, was an American girl group based in Miami, composed of Ally Brooke, Normani,
    Dinah Jane, Lauren Jauregui, and Camila Cabello until her departure from the group in December 2016. Camila Cabello
    was my favourite of the quintet.
    The band was and still is my favourite band of all time because I could relate to their songs and it goes without
    that their talents are impeccable.
